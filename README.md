# ATM-
ATM  By Using Core Java

The Java ATM System is a software project designed to simulate the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project provides users with a virtual interface to perform typical ATM transactions such as withdrawing cash, depositing funds and checking their account balance.

Key Features:

User Authentication: The system requires users to authenticate themselves using a unique username and PIN (Personal Identification Number) combination before accessing their accounts.

Withdrawal: Users can withdraw funds from their accounts by entering the desired amount. The system checks for available balance and dispenses cash accordingly.

Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their accounts by inserting cash into the ATM. The system updates the account balance accordingly.

Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balance to view the current amount of funds available in their accounts.

Transaction History: The system maintains a record of all transactions performed by users, including details such as transaction type, amount, date, and time.

User-Friendly Interface: The ATM system features an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, allowing users to navigate through different options effortlessly.

This Java ATM System project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing banking transactions in a simulated ATM environment. It demonstrates core concepts of object-oriented programming, data management, and system security in Java.
